The coloring logic for the bins in this code creates a visual heatmap of price levels based on frequency of touches, with colors distributed in a Gaussian-like pattern around the most frequently touched price level. Let me walk you through how it works:
Point of Control and Bin Coloring
The core of the coloring logic is found in section 8 of the code where the boxes are drawn and colored. Here's how it works:

Point of Control (PoC) Identification:

The PoC is the price bin that has been touched the most frequently
The code finds this by looping through all bins and finding the one with the highest hit count
This bin (stored in pocIndex) becomes the center reference point for coloring


Color Bands Based on Distance from PoC:

The script establishes bands that approximate a normal distribution (68-95-99.7 rule)
It creates specific boundaries at approximately:

band1 = 0.3413 (≈34% from the center)
band2 = 0.4772 (≈48% from the center)
band3 = 0.6131 (≈61% from the center)
band4 = 0.6345 (≈63% from the center)




Distance Calculation:

For each bin, it calculates binDistFrac which represents how far that bin is from the PoC
This is normalized to be between 0 and 1 (where 0 means it's the PoC, and 1 means it's at the extreme edge)
The calculation: binDistFrac = (math.abs(i - pocIndex)) / halfBins


Color Assignment:

The PoC bin itself is colored yellow
Other bins are colored based on their distance from the PoC:
CopybinColor := binDistFrac <= band1 ? color.new(color.lime, 0) : 
            binDistFrac <= band2 ? color.new(color.green, 0) : 
            binDistFrac <= band3 ? color.new(color.orange, 0) : 
            binDistFrac <= band4 ? color.new(color.red, 0) : 
            color.new(color.blue, 0)


This creates a gradient effect:

Yellow: Point of Control (max hits)
Light Green: Bins within ~34% distance of PoC
Green: Bins within ~48% distance of PoC
Orange: Bins within ~61% distance of PoC
Red: Bins within ~63% distance of PoC
Blue: Bins beyond 63% distance from PoC


Box Width Proportionality:

Each bin's box width is proportional to the number of hits it has received
The width is calculated as a fraction of the maximum hits (up to 300 bars wide):
CopyboxWidth = maxHits > 0 ? (hits / maxHits) * 300 : 1

This creates a visual volume profile where wider boxes represent more frequently touched price levels



The result is a color-coded histogram that forms a volume profile anchored at the cutoff time, showing which price levels were most active up to that point, with colors that help visually identify the distribution of price action around the most active level (PoC).
